## Project description

To Do or Not To Do is a simple yet effective task management application that allows users to create, edit, view, and delete their tasks. The app provides a user-friendly interface for individuals who want to organize their to-do lists without unnecessary complexity. Tasks are private to each user and only accessible after logging in.

This project aims to streamline task management for users with busy lifestyles, enabling them to stay on top of their daily responsibilities.

### User demographics

The application targets individuals who require a structured way to manage their daily tasks, such as professionals, students, or anyone looking for a straightforward task management solution. Whether itâ€™s tracking errands, organizing projects, or planning events, the application caters to a wide audience.

## User Interface Design (UI)

The design centers on simplicity and functionality. The interface avoids unnecessary graphics or clutter to ensure a clean and intuitive user experience. For example, users can quickly view their tasks, mark them as complete, or delete them without navigating through complex menus.

### Inspiration

I wanted to do a simple to do list as I find them very useful in my own life. For example I like to keep reference numbers for billing companies or make lists if it's a birthday or Christmas. The way I have set it out means I can make a list for a certain individual and then list items in the description. Once these items have been purchased I can have a visual representation of whether it is complete or not.

I wanted to make is so simple that there was no reason to complicate the application with instructions, as in my experience no one reads them or if they do they can be confusing for the user. 

I also did not want to use pictures or fancy graphics as this can be distract from the overall functionality of the application. 

### Wireframes

The app was envisioned as a minimalistic layout where tasks are displayed in a central box. Color contrast was considered to enhance readability and usability.

### Brand Identity

The application uses a bright orange theme for buttons and highlights, combined with a soft peach background for contrast. The Lexend font was chosen for its readability, aligning with the project's focus on simplicity.

### Interaction Design

TThe app minimises unnecessary interactions. The primary interactions include:

-Creating tasks via a simple form.
-Editing tasks directly from the task list.
-Marking tasks as complete.
-Deleting tasks with confirmation.


### Accessibility

Accessibility was prioritised in the design. The use of high-contrast colors and simple navigation ensures that the application is usable for a wide range of users. Issues such as missing navigation bars were identified and addressed during testing.
